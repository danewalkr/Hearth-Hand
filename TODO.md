== HOME PAGE ==
- Re-adjust wording
  - Ensure mobile spacing

- Sit down with denise to verify: wording, photos, coloring
  - Update footer content with her

== Portfolio Page ==

- Portfolio Hero
  - Headline: who you help + what you handle
  - Short subheading reinforcing calm, trust, and outcomes
  - Primary CTA (soft): “Start a Conversation” or “View Our Work”

- Framing / Expectation Setter (short)
  - 1–2 lines explaining how work is shown
  - Reinforces outcomes over highlight reels
  - Prepares users for compact cards + deeper “Learn More”

- Services-as-Evidence Section (Cards)
  - Reuses service card component (OK and intentional)
  - Grid or compact layout (not carousel)
  - Purpose here is proof, not discovery
  - Each card includes:
    - Image
    - Service name
    - Outcome-driven one-liner
    - “Learn More”

  NOTE:
  - This feels different from the homepage because:
    - No hero overlay
    - No carousel momentum
    - Context is “work we’ve done,” not “what we offer”

- Learn More Interaction (Popup or Service Detail Page)
  Triggered only after intent (click)

      <p class="story-lead">Judy founded Hearth & Hand after 35 years of managing spaces that mattered—restaurants,
        medical offices, family homes, community hubs. She learned that great service isn't transactional. It's
        relational.</p>

      <h3 class="story-detail-title">A Different Kind of Leadership</h3>
      <p>As an ADHD Latina who's run teams, navigated bureaucracy, and juggled multiple cities, she knows what it's like
        to need systems that just work. No extra noise. No wasted steps. Just calm, competent execution.</p>
      <p>That philosophy shaped everything: how we hire, how we train, how we show up for clients.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-detail-block anim-fade-up anim-delay-2">
      <h3 class="story-detail-title">From Hospitality to Home</h3>
      <p>After years of running Mason's Famous Lobster Rolls in downtown Charleston—managing daily service, building
        teams, and learning what consistency actually means—she decided to build something more intimate and
        intentional.</p>
      <p>Hearth & Hand was born from one idea: if you treat someone's home with the same care you'd give a thriving
        restaurant, everything changes.</p>

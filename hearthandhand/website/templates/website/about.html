      <p class="story-lead animate-fade-in-up animate-delay-900">Judy founded Hearth & Hand after 35 years in service:
        restaurants, medical offices, family
        businesses, community spaces. She learned early that great service isn't about transactions. It's about
        relationships.</p>

      <h3 class="story-detail-title">A Different Kind of Leadership</h3>
      <p>As an ADHD Latina who's managed teams, navigated complex systems, and split time between cities, Judy knows
        what it means to need support that actually works. No wasted energy. No complicated systems. Just calm, reliable
        execution.</p>
      <p>That's the philosophy that built Hearth & Hand. It shapes how we hire, how we train, how we show up for every
        client.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-detail-block anim-fade-up anim-delay-2">
      <h3 class="story-detail-title">From Restaurant to Home</h3>
      <p>Judy ran Mason's Famous Lobster Rolls in downtown Charleston for years. She managed daily service, built teams,
        and learned what consistency really means. Then she decided to build something more personal and intentional.
      </p>
      <p>Hearth & Hand came from one belief: if you treat someone's home with the same care you'd give a great
        restaurant, everything changes.</p>

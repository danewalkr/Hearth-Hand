        <h2>We handle what matters, so you can focus on what's important</h2>
        <p>After 35 years in service-driven businesses, we know how to run a household or event with precision,
          discretion, and warmth. We don't just check boxes. We understand rhythm. We respect your home. We show up
          consistently, prepared, and calm.</p>
        <p>Whether you need weekly household support, help with an event, seasonal preparation, or something custom, we
          bring systems that work and a presence that feels like part of your team.</p>

          <p><strong>The difference: we don't treat your home like a job site. We treat it like what it is—your
              sanctuary.</strong></p>

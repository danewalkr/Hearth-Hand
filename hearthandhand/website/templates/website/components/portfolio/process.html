      <h3>We Ask Good Questions</h3>
      <p>What matters most to you? What's the timeline? Are there special vendors or routines we need to know about? We
        listen more than we talk.</p>

      <h3>We Coordinate Behind the Scenes</h3>
      <p>Vendors, rentals, schedules, deliveries. We handle it. You get updates when something needs your input, not
        every five minutes.</p>
